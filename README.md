# Lifelog-FPImgCapHRC

FPImgCapHRC is a first-person image and caption dataset labeled by human-robot collaboration, which is an extension of the dataset released from the fourth Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC'21).

You could download part of the human-labeled image captions, which are released in this repository. The complete dataset will be made available online after our paper is accepted.
